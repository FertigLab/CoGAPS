\usage{
patternMarkers(Amatrix = NA, scaledPmatrix = FALSE, Pmatrix = NA,
  threshold = "all", lp = NA, full = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Amatrix}{A matrix of genes by weights resulting from CoGAPS or other NMF decomposition}

\item{scaledPmatrix}{logical indicating whether the corresponding pattern matrix was fixed to have max 1 during decomposition}

\item{Pmatrix}{the corresponding Pmatrix (patterns X samples) for the provided Amatrix (genes x patterns). This must be supplied if scaledPmatrix is FALSE.}

\item{threshold}{# the type of threshold to be used. The default "all" will distribute genes into pattern with the lowest ranking. The "cut" thresholding by the first gene to have a lower ranking, i.e. better fit to, a pattern.}

\item{lp}{a vector of weights for each pattern to be used for finding markers. If NA markers for each pattern of the A matrix will be used.}

\item{full}{logical indicating whether to return the ranks of each gene for each pattern}
}
\value{
By default a non-overlapping list of genes associated with each \code{lp}. If \code{full=TRUE} a data.frame of
genes rankings with a column for each \code{lp} will also be returned.

# Load the outputs from gapsRun

# Run patternMarkers with the correct arguments from 'results'
patternMarkers(Amatrix=results$Amean,scaledPmatrix=FALSE,
Pmatrix=results$Pmean,threshold="all",full=TRUE)
