CoGAPS                  'CoGAPS' calls the C++ MCMC code through
                        gapsRun and performs Bayesian matrix
                        factorization returning the two matrices that
                        reconstruct the data matrix and then calls
                        calcCoGAPSStat to estimate gene set activity
                        with nPerm set to 500

binaryA                 'binaryA' creates a binarized heatmap of the A
                        matrix in which the value is 1 if the value in
                        Amean is greater than threshold * Asd and 0
                        otherwise
calcCoGAPSStat          'calcCoGAPSStat' calculates the gene set
                        statistics for each column of A using a Z-score
                        from the elements of the A matrix, the input
                        gene set, and permutation tests
calcGeneGSStat          'calcGeneGSStat' calculates the probability
                        that a gene listed in a gene set behaves like
                        other genes in the set within the given data
                        set
calcZ                   'calcZ' calculates the Z-score for each element

gapsMapRun              'gapsMapRun' calls the C++ MCMC code and

                        data matrix; as opposed to gapsRun, this method

                        performs Bayesian matrix factorization
                        returning the two matrices that reconstruct the
                        data matrix; as opposed to gapsRun, this method

                        patterns in the P matrix
gapsRun                 'gapsRun' calls the C++ MCMC code and performs
                        Bayesian matrix factorization returning the two
                        matrices that reconstruct the data matrix
