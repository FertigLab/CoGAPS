Title: Coordinated Gene Activity in Pattern Sets
Author: Elana J. Fertig, Michael F. Ochs
Description: Coordinated Gene Activity in Pattern Sets (CoGAPS) 
    implements a Bayesian MCMC matrix factorization algorithm,
    GAPS, and links it to gene set statistic methods to infer biological
    process activity.  It can be used to perform sparse matrix factorization on
    any data, and when this data represents biomolecules, to do gene set
    analysis.
