	Abstract = {SUMMARY: Coordinated Gene Activity in Pattern Sets (CoGAPS) provides an integrated package for isolating gene expression driven by a biological process, enhancing inference of biological processes from transcriptomic data. CoGAPS improves on other enrichment measurement methods by combining a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) matrix factorization algorithm (GAPS) with a threshold-independent statistic inferring activity on gene sets. The software is provided as open source C++ code built on top of JAGS software with an R interface. AVAILABILITY: The R package CoGAPS and the C++ package GAPS-JAGS are provided open source under the GNU Lesser Public License (GLPL) with a users manual containing installation and operating instructions. CoGAPS is available through Bioconductor and depends on the rjags package available through CRAN to interface CoGAPS with GAPS-JAGS. URL: http://www.cancerbiostats.onc.jhmi.edu/cogaps.cfm .},

@article{Tavazoie1999,
	Abstract = {Technologies to measure whole-genome mRNA abundances and methods to organize and display such data are emerging as valuable tools for systems-level exploration of transcriptional regulatory networks. For instance, it has been shown that mRNA data from 118 genes, measured at several time points in the developing hindbrain of mice, can be hierarchically clustered into various patterns (or 'waves') whose members tend to participate in common processes. We have previously shown that hierarchical clustering can group together genes whose cis-regulatory elements are bound by the same proteins in vivo. Hierarchical clustering has also been used to organize genes into hierarchical dendograms on the basis of their expression across multiple growth conditions. The application of Fourier analysis to synchronized yeast mRNA expression data has identified cell-cycle periodic genes, many of which have expected cis-regulatory elements. Here we apply a systematic set of statistical algorithms, based on whole-genome mRNA data, partitional clustering and motif discovery, to identify transcriptional regulatory sub-networks in yeast-without any a priori knowledge of their structure or any assumptions about their dynamics. This approach uncovered new regulons (sets of co-regulated genes) and their putative cis-regulatory elements. We used statistical characterization of known regulons and motifs to derive criteria by which we infer the biological significance of newly discovered regulons and motifs. Our approach holds promise for the rapid elucidation of genetic network architecture in sequenced organisms in which little biology is known.},

@article{Goeman2007,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many statistical tests have been proposed in recent years for analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets, usually from Gene Ontology. These methods are based on widely different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expression of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set testing. RESULTS: We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.},

@article{Lee1999,
	Abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

@article{Subramanian2005,
	Abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

	Abstract = {Onto-Tools is a set of four seamlessly integrated databases: Onto-Express, Onto-Compare, Onto-Design and Onto-Translate. Onto-Express is able to automatically translate lists of genes found to be differentially regulated in a given condition into functional profiles characterizing the impact of the condition studied upon various biological processes and pathways. OE constructs functional profiles (using Gene Ontology terms) for the following categories: biochemical function, biological process, cellular role, cellular component, molecular function and chromosome location. Statistical significance values are calculated for each category. Once the initial exploratory analysis identified a number of relevant biological processes, specific mechanisms of interactions can be hypothesized for the conditions studied. Currently, many commercial arrays are available for the investigation of specific mechanisms. Each such array is characterized by a biological bias determined by the extent to which the genes present on the array represent specific pathways. Onto-Compare is a tool that allows efficient comparisons of any sets of commercial or custom arrays. Using Onto-Compare, a researcher can determine quickly which array, or set of arrays, covers best the hypotheses studied. In many situations, no commercial arrays are available for specific biological mechanisms. Onto-Design is a tool that allows the user to select genes that represent given functional categories. Onto-Translate allows the user to translate easily lists of accession numbers, UniGene clusters and Affymetrix probes into one another. All tools above are seamlessly integrated.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: As numerous diseases involve errors in signal transduction, modern therapeutics often target proteins involved in cellular signaling. Interpretation of the activity of signaling pathways during disease development or therapeutic intervention would assist in drug development, design of therapy, and target identification. Microarrays provide a global measure of cellular response, however linking these responses to signaling pathways requires an analytic approach tuned to the underlying biology. An ongoing issue in pattern recognition in microarrays has been how to determine the number of patterns (or clusters) to use for data interpretation, and this is a critical issue as measures of statistical significance in gene ontology or pathways rely on proper separation of genes into groups. RESULTS: Here we introduce a method relying on gene annotation coupled to decompositional analysis of global gene expression data that allows us to estimate specific activity on strongly coupled signaling pathways and, in some cases, activity of specific signaling proteins. We demonstrate the technique using the Rosetta yeast deletion mutant data set, decompositional analysis by Bayesian Decomposition, and annotation analysis using ClutrFree. We determined from measurements of gene persistence in patterns across multiple potential dimensionalities that 15 basis vectors provides the correct dimensionality for interpreting the data. Using gene ontology and data on gene regulation in the Saccharomyces Genome Database, we identified the transcriptional signatures of several cellular processes in yeast, including cell wall creation, ribosomal disruption, chemical blocking of protein synthesis, and, critically, individual signatures of the strongly coupled mating and filamentation pathways. CONCLUSION: This works demonstrates that microarray data can provide downstream indicators of pathway activity either through use of gene ontology or transcription factor databases. This can be used to investigate the specificity and success of targeted therapeutics as well as to elucidate signaling activity in normal and disease processes.},

	Abstract = {Many biological processes rely on remodeling of the transcriptional response of cells through activation of transcription factors. Although determination of the activity level of transcription factors from microarray data can provide insight into developmental and disease processes, it requires careful analysis because of the multiple regulation of genes. We present a novel approach that handles both the assignment of genes to multiple patterns, as required by multiple regulation, and the linking of genes in prior probability distributions according to their known transcriptional regulators. We demonstrate the power of this approach in simulations and by application to yeast cell cycle and deletion mutant data. The results of simulations in the presence of increasing noise showed improved recovery of patterns in terms of chi2 fit. Analysis of the yeast data led to improved inference of biologically meaningful groups in comparison to other techniques, as demonstrated with ROC analysis. The new algorithm provides an approach for estimating the levels of transcription factor activity from microarray data, and therefore provides insights into biological response.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray and gene chip technology provide high throughput tools for measuring gene expression levels in a variety of circumstances, including cellular response to drug treatment, cellular growth and development, tumorigenesis, among many other processes. In order to interpret the large data sets generated in experiments, data analysis techniques that consider biological knowledge during analysis will be extremely useful. We present here results showing the application of such a tool to expression data from yeast cell cycle experiments. RESULTS: Originally developed for spectroscopic analysis, Bayesian Decomposition (BD) includes two features which make it useful for microarray data analysis: the ability to assign genes to multiple coexpression groups and the ability to encode biological knowledge into the system. Here we demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to provide insight into the yeast cell cycle, including identification of five temporal patterns tied to cell cycle phases as well as the identification of a pattern tied to an approximately 40 min cell cycle oscillator. The genes are simultaneously assigned to the patterns, including partial assignment to multiple patterns when this is required to explain the expression profile.

@article{Ochs1999,
	Abstract = {A frequent problem in analysis is the need to find two matrices, closely related to the underlying measurement process, which when multiplied together reproduce the matrix of data points. Such problems arise throughout science, for example, in imaging where both the calibration of the sensor and the true scene may be unknown and in localized spectroscopy where multiple components may be present in varying amounts in any spectrum. Since both matrices are unknown, such a decomposition is a bilinear problem. We report here a solution to this problem for the case in which the decomposition results in matrices with elements drawn from positive additive distributions. We demonstrate the power of the methodology on chemical shift images (CSI). The new method, Bayesian spectral decomposition (BSD), reduces the CSI data to a small number of basis spectra together with their localized amplitudes. We apply this new algorithm to a 19F nonlocalized study of the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil in human liver, 31P CSI studies of a human head and calf muscle, and simulations which show its strengths and limitations. In all cases, the dataset, viewed as a matrix with rows containing the individual NMR spectra, results from the multiplication of a matrix of generally nonorthogonal basis spectra (the spectral matrix) by a matrix of the amplitudes of each basis spectrum in the the individual voxels (the amplitude matrix). The results show that BSD can simultaneously determine both the basis spectra and their distribution. In principle, BSD should solve this bilinear problem for any dataset which results from multiplication of matrices representing positive additive distributions if the data overdetermine the solutions.},

	Abstract = {Cell signaling plays a central role in the etiology of cancer. Numerous therapeutics in use or under development target signaling proteins; however, off-target effects often limit assignment of positive clinical response to the intended target. As direct measurements of signaling protein activity are not generally feasible during treatment, there is a need for more powerful methods to determine if therapeutics inhibit their targets and when off-target effects occur. We have used the Bayesian Decomposition algorithm and data on transcriptional regulation to create a novel methodology, Differential Expression for Signaling Determination (DESIDE), for inferring signaling activity from microarray measurements. We applied DESIDE to deduce signaling activity in gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell lines treated with the targeted therapeutic imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). We detected the expected reduced activity in the KIT pathway, as well as unexpected changes in the p53 pathway. Pursuing these findings, we have determined that imatinib-induced DNA damage is responsible for the increased activity of p53, identifying a novel off-target activity for this drug. We then used DESIDE on data from resected, post-imatinib treatment tumor samples and identified a pattern in these tumors similar to that at late time points in the cell lines, and this pattern correlated with initial clinical response. The pattern showed increased activity of ETS domain-containing protein Elk-1 and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 transcription factors, which are associated with the growth of side population cells. DESIDE infers the global reprogramming of signaling networks during treatment, permitting treatment modification that leverages ongoing drug development efforts, which is crucial for personalized medicine.},
