# All conflicts needed to be considered for a truly equal algo

## Birth
- (ignore for now) track all atoms that are selected in death/move
    /exchange, if a position is selected that conflicts with one 
    of those atoms, we can't proceed since it is possible that 
    position will be free when the birth happens
- track previous births to make sure no overwriting happens

## Death
- (ignore for now) if any atom is birthed before this step then
    it should be possible to select it
- track all atoms selected for death/exchange if any atom is
    destroyed before this step we can't destroy it again

## Move
- Same selection problem as death
- can't have any atoms birth/death/move/exchange within the
    selected atom's boundaries

## Exchange
- Same selection problem as death
- Similiar problem as move with selecting exchanged atom

can't ignore birthed atoms, death/move/exchange fail if randomAtom returns a newly birthed atom
